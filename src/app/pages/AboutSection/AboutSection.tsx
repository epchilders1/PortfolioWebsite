            <p>Hello! My name is Evan, I am software engineer studying CS and Math at Alabama. I build full-stack applications, work with ML pipelines, and care about writing code that people will use.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on university safety systems as a software developer coop at CAPS and I'm scaling an AI platform for sorority recruitment. I'm drawn to problems that start on a whiteboard and end up in production.</p>
